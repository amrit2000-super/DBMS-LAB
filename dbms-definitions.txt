DATAMODEL:
  A COLLECTION OF CONCEPTS WHICH CAN BE USED TO DESCRIBE THE STRUCTURE OF THE DATABASE 

HIGH LEVEL DATA MODEL:
  PROVIDES THE CONCEPTS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE WAY THE USERS PERCIEVE THE DATA
  
LOW LEVEL DATA MODEL:
  PROVIDES THE CONCEPTS WHICH ARE CLOSE TO DETAILS HOW THE DATA IS STORED IN THE COMPUTER
  
REPRESENTATIONAL DATA MODEL:
  PROVIDES THE CONCEPTS WHICH CAN BE UNDERSTOOD BY THE END USERS ON THE SAME TIME NO TOO REMOVED FROM THE WAY THE DATA IS ORGANISED IN THE COMPUTER

  DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASE,WHICH IS SPECIFIED DURING THE DATABASE CREATION AND EXPECTED NOT TO CHANGE FREQUENTLY
  
SCHEMA DIAGRAM:
  A DISPLAYED SCHEMA 
  
SCHEMA CONSTRUCT:
  EACH OBJECT IN THE SCHEMA DIAGRAM
  
SNAPSHOT / DATABASE STATE(ALSO CALLED "OCCURENCES / INSTANCES" IN THE DATABASE):
  THE DATA IN THE DATABASE AT A PARTICULAR INSTANCE OF TIME 
  
METADATA:
  THE DESCRIPTION OF THE SCHEMA CONSTRUCTS OR THE INSTANCES
  
INTENSION:
  SCHEMA OF THE DATABASE
  
EXTENSION:
  STATE OF THE DATABASE
  
SCHEMA EVOLUTION:
  ADDITION OF EXTRA DATA ITEMS INTO THE SCHEMA
  
MAPPINGS:
  THE PROCESS OF TRANSFROMING REQUESTS AND RESULTS BETWEEN TWO LAYERS OR LEVELS 
  
DATA INDEPENDENCE(DEFINED USING 3 LEVEL ARCHITECTURE AS REFERENCE):
  THE CAPABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE SCHEMA OF A LOWER LEVEL IN THE ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF CHANGING THAT OF THE UPPER LEVEL

LOGICAL DATA INDEPENDENCE:
  THE CAPABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE SCHEMA OF A CONCEPTUAL LEVEL IN THE ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF CHANGING THAT OF THE EXTERNAL LEVEL
  
PHYSICAL DATA INDEPENDENCE:
  THE CAPABILITY OF BEING ABLE TO CHANGE THE SCHEMA OF A INTERNAL LEVEL IN THE ARCHITECTURE WITHOUT THE NEED OF CHANGING THAT OF THE CONCPTUAL LEVEL
  
SIMPLE ATTRIBUTE:
  ATTRIBUTE WHICH TAKES A SINGLE VALUE
  
COMPOSITE ATTRIBUTE:
  AN ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS THE COLLECTION OF TWO OR MORE ATTRIBUTES
  
MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTE:
  ATTRIBUTE WHICH TAKES MULTIPLE VALUES
  
DERIVED ATTRIBUTE:
  ATTRIBUTE WHICH IS DERIVED OR WHOSE VALUE IS AUTOMATICALLY DECIDED BY AN EXISTING ATTRIBUTE
  
COMPLEX ATTRIBUTE:
  MULTIVALUED ATTRIBUTES WHICH ARE NESTED WITHIN {} 
  
KEY ATTRIBUTE:
  AN ATTRIBUTE WHOSE VALUES ARE DIFFERNT FOR EVERY RECORD IN THE TABLE AND NOT NULL 
  
ENTITY TYPE:
  A COLLECTION OF ENTITIES WHICH HAVE THE SAME ATTRIBUTES
  
ENTITY SET:
  COLLECTION OF ALL ENTITY TYPES WHICH ARE PRESENT IN A DATABASE AT ANY POINT OF TIME
  
VALUE SET:
  DEFINES THE VALUES WHICH CAN BE ASSIGNED TO THAT PARTICUKAR ATTRIBUTE FOR EVERY INDIVIDUAL ENTRY
  
DEGREE OF RELATIONSHIP:
  THE NUMBER OF ENTITY TYPES PARTICIPATING IN THE RELATIONSHIP
  1.UNARY-ONE ENTITY TYPE
  2.BINARY-TWO ENTITY TYPE
  3.TERNARY-THREE ENTITY TYPE
  
RELATIONSHIP TYPE:
  TYPE OF RELATION WHICH CAN EXIST BETWEEN TWO DIFFERENT ENTITY TYPES 
  
RELATIONSHIP INSTANCE:
  A SET OF TUPLES ALSO CALLED RECORDS, WHICH HAVE SAME NUMBER OF ATTROBUTES AS THAT OF THE RELATIONSHIP SCHEMA
  
CARDINALITY RATIO(FOR BINARY RELATIONSHIPS):
  MAXIMUM NUMBER OF RELATIONSHIP INSTANCES AN ENTITY CAN PARTICIPATE FOR
  
WEAK ENTITY TYPES:
  ENTITIES WHICH DONT HAVE KEY ATTRIBUTES OF THEIR OWN
  
DOMAIN:
  A DOMAIN D IS A SET OF ATOMIC VALUES.
  BY ATOMIC VALUES WE MEAN THAT EACH VALUE IN THE DOMAIN IS INDIVISIBLE AS FAR AS THE FORMAL RELATIONAL MODEL IS CONCERNED.
  
RELATIONAL SCHEMA:
  USED TO DEFINE A RELATION
